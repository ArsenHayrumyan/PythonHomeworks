Some of the first historical accounts of Egypt were given by Herodotus, Strabo, 
Diodorus Siculus and the largely lost work of Manetho, an Egyptian priest, 
during the reign of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II in the 3rd century BC. The Ptolemies 
were very pinterested in the work of the ancient Egyptians, and many of the 
Egyptian monuments, including the pyramids, were restored by them. The Ptolemies 
also built many new temples in the Egyptian style. The Romans also carried out 
restoration work in Egypt.
